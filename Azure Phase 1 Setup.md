Let’s move forward using **Azure Data Factory**, **Synapse Analytics**, **Data Lake**, and related services to build the **medallion architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold tiers) for data ingestion and exploration. Here’s a detailed guide for Phase 1:

### **Phase 1: Implementing the Medallion Model Without Fabric**

#### **Step 1: Set Up Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)**
The data lake will serve as the central storage for your medallion architecture, where raw data (Bronze), cleansed data (Silver), and transformed/aggregated data (Gold) are stored.

1. **Create an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Account**:
   - In the Azure portal, search for **Storage Accounts** and click **+ Create**.
   - Choose your **Resource Group** (e.g., `EcommerceInsightsRG`).
   - Select the **Region** that’s closest to you for reduced latency.
   - Enable **Hierarchical Namespace** in the **Advanced** tab to make it Data Lake Gen2.
   - Click **Review + Create** and wait for the deployment.

2. **Create Containers for the Medallion Architecture**:
   - Inside your storage account, create three containers:
     - `bronze` (for raw data ingestion)
     - `silver` (for cleaned and transformed data)
     - `gold` (for final aggregated data ready for analytics)

#### **Step 2: Set Up Azure Data Factory for Data Ingestion**
Azure Data Factory (ADF) will orchestrate the data ingestion from public sources into the **Bronze layer** (raw data).

1. **Create a Data Factory**:
   - In the Azure portal, search for **Data Factory** and click **+ Create**.
   - Choose the **Resource Group** and **Region**.
   - Enter a name for your Data Factory (e.g., `EcommerceADF`).
   - Click **Review + Create** and wait for the deployment.

2. **Ingest Public eCommerce Data into the Bronze Layer**:
   - In **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**, open the **Author & Monitor** tool.
   - Create a **Linked Service** to the data source (e.g., **HTTP**, **Azure Blob**, **SQL**, or public APIs like Kaggle datasets).
   - Create a **Pipeline**:
     - Add a **Copy Activity** to copy data from the source into your **Bronze container** in **ADLS**.
     - For example, ingest an eCommerce dataset like **UCI Online Retail** or other public datasets from Kaggle.
   - Set up a **Trigger** to either run the pipeline immediately or on a schedule.

3. **Monitor the Data Ingestion**:
   - Once the pipeline runs, check the **Bronze container** in ADLS to ensure the raw data has been successfully ingested.

#### **Step 3: Set Up Azure Synapse Analytics for Data Transformation**
Azure Synapse Analytics will be used for transforming data from the Bronze layer to Silver and Gold layers.

1. **Create a Synapse Workspace**:
   - In the Azure portal, search for **Synapse Analytics** and click **+ Create**.
   - Choose your **Resource Group** and **Region**.
   - Provide a **Workspace Name** (e.g., `EcommerceSynapse`).
   - Select your **Data Lake** storage account created in Step 1 for storage.
   - Click **Review + Create** and wait for deployment.

2. **Set Up Synapse Serverless SQL Pool**:
   - In Synapse Studio, navigate to **SQL pools** and use the **Serverless SQL pool** to query the data without provisioning dedicated resources.
   - Use **SQL scripts** to query and explore the data in the Bronze layer.

3. **Explore Raw Data (Bronze)**:
   - Connect to your **Bronze container** and run **exploratory queries** on the raw data to understand its structure.
   - For example, analyze the transaction logs, customer IDs, and product details in the eCommerce dataset.

#### **Step 4: Transform Data from Bronze to Silver Layer**
Now, let’s move the data from the **Bronze** (raw) layer to the **Silver** (cleaned and refined) layer.

1. **Create Data Flows in Azure Data Factory**:
   - In ADF, create a new **Mapping Data Flow** to transform the raw data.
   - Apply data cleaning operations:
     - Remove duplicates.
     - Handle missing values.
     - Standardize column formats (e.g., date formats, customer ID formats).
   - Write the transformed data to the **Silver container** in your ADLS.

2. **Create a Pipeline for Bronze to Silver**:
   - Create a pipeline in ADF to move data from **Bronze** to **Silver** using the **Mapping Data Flow** you created.
   - Schedule this pipeline to run after the data ingestion is complete.

#### **Step 5: Move Data from Silver to Gold Layer**
The **Gold layer** will contain the final aggregated and curated data for business reporting and analysis.

1. **Apply Advanced Transformations (Silver to Gold)**:
   - Use **Synapse Studio** to apply advanced transformations such as:
     - Aggregations (e.g., total sales by customer, product, or region).
     - Creating customer segments (e.g., loyal customers, frequent buyers).
     - Calculating customer lifetime value (CLV).
   - Save the output to the **Gold container** in ADLS.

2. **Query Gold Data**:
   - Once the data is moved to the **Gold layer**, use **Synapse SQL** to query the final dataset for reporting.
   - The Gold data should be clean, well-structured, and ready for **Power BI** dashboards.

#### **Step 6: Data Exploration and Power BI Integration**
At this stage, you can begin exploring the **Gold layer** for insights and prepare to build **Power BI dashboards**.

1. **Data Exploration in Synapse**:
   - In **Synapse Studio**, query the **Gold container** using **SQL on-demand** or **Apache Spark** to perform data exploration and profiling.
   - Explore key metrics like total sales, product categories, loyalty program usage, and customer segmentation.

2. **Power BI Connection**:
   - Once your **Gold layer** is ready, connect **Power BI Desktop** to your Synapse SQL or ADLS storage.
   - Create dashboards to visualize key metrics, such as:
     - Customer purchase trends.
     - Loyalty program engagement.
     - Product popularity and regional sales.

### **Next Steps**
Once the data ingestion and exploration phase is complete, the next phase would involve applying more advanced analytics, including predictive modeling (e.g., customer churn prediction), and further refining the data transformation process.

Would you like to dive deeper into any of these steps, or do you need help configuring specific services for this phase?

Data Factory is in preview mode - Not ready for prime time and requires organizational support
### **obsolete ==============================================================**

Let's proceed with developing your project using Azure Data Fabric and implementing the **medallion architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers). I'll guide you step by step on setting up One Data for each tier and configuring Azure Data Factory to ingest the public e-commerce data.


### **Phase 1: Setting Up the Medallion Architecture in One Data**

#### **Step 1: Set Up One Data in Microsoft Fabric**

1. **Go to One Data**:
   - Navigate to Microsoft Fabric within the Azure portal.
   - In your resource group, create a new **One Data workspace**. This will be the container for all your data processing stages (Bronze, Silver, and Gold).

2. **Create Three Data Layers (Bronze, Silver, Gold)**:
   - **Bronze (Raw Data)**: This is where you store raw, ingested data from the source systems with minimal transformations.
   - **Silver (Cleaned and Refined Data)**: After processing and cleaning the data, you move it to the Silver tier. In this tier, basic transformations such as removing duplicates, fixing nulls, and applying preliminary joins occur.
   - **Gold (Aggregated Data)**: The Gold layer contains final, polished datasets ready for analysis and reporting. Advanced transformations and aggregations are done here.

3. **Create Lakehouses for Each Tier**:
   - Inside the One Data workspace, create **three separate Lakehouses** for each tier:
     - **BronzeLakehouse**
     - **SilverLakehouse**
     - **GoldLakehouse**

These lakehouses will act as the storage for your data at each stage.

#### **Step 2: Set Up Azure Data Factory for Data Ingestion**

Azure Data Factory (ADF) will handle the data pipelines, moving data from public sources to the Bronze layer (raw data) and later from Bronze to Silver and Gold as we apply transformations.

1. **Create Data Factory**:
   - In the Azure portal, create a new **Data Factory** resource (if not already created). This will handle the orchestration of data ingestion and transformations.

2. **Ingest Public eCommerce Data**:
   - Identify a public dataset for e-commerce. For example:
     - The **UCI Online Retail dataset** or other publicly available sources on **Kaggle** (like a customer transaction dataset).
   - In **Data Factory**, create a new **Linked Service** to connect to the data source (it could be HTTP, Azure Blob, or another service).
   - **Create a Pipeline** that ingests this data into the **BronzeLakehouse**:
     - Define a **Copy Activity** to move the data from the public dataset into your **Bronze** layer in **One Data**.
     - In this process, use **ADLS Gen2** as a source if needed, or directly copy the data from the public dataset source.

3. **Schedule Data Ingestion**:
   - Use ADF’s **Triggers** to schedule the data ingestion pipeline. You can configure it to run on-demand or on a regular schedule (daily, weekly, etc.).

#### **Step 3: Data Exploration in the Bronze Layer**

Once the data is ingested into the **BronzeLakehouse** (raw tier), you can begin exploring the raw data to prepare for transformation.

1. **Access Data from Synapse or Databricks**:
   - Connect to **Azure Synapse Analytics** (or **Databricks** if you prefer Spark-based exploration).
   - Use **SQL** to query and explore the raw data ingested in the Bronze layer.
   - Perform **basic data profiling**: Check for missing values, outliers, or patterns in the raw data. Look for key attributes like customer ID, transaction dates, loyalty program details, etc.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Use **Azure Synapse Studio** or **Databricks notebooks** to visualize data distributions, check correlations, and get an initial understanding of the dataset.
   - You can also use **Spark** or **SQL** to get summary statistics like average purchase amount, most frequent transaction categories, and common customer demographics.

#### **Step 4: Preparing for Data Transformation (Bronze to Silver)**

Once you've explored the raw data, start preparing for transformation:

1. **Define Transformation Logic**:
   - Based on your exploratory analysis, decide which transformations are needed for the **Silver (Cleaned) layer**:
     - Remove duplicates or erroneous records.
     - Standardize formats (e.g., date formats, customer IDs).
     - Handle missing values (e.g., through imputation or removal).
     - Apply initial joins between datasets (if applicable).

2. **Create Data Factory Pipelines** for Transformation:
   - In Azure Data Factory, create **new pipelines** to move data from the Bronze layer to the Silver layer.
   - Use **Data Flows** or **Mapping Data Flows** in ADF to apply the transformations. Mapping Data Flows allows you to define transformation steps without writing code (drag-and-drop interface).
   - In these data flows, clean the data and load it into the **SilverLakehouse**.

#### **Step 5: Saving and Scaling for the Gold Tier**

After the Silver transformations are applied:

1. **Move Data to the Gold Tier**:
   - Once the Silver layer is populated with clean and refined data, apply any advanced transformations needed for your reporting and analysis in the **Gold layer**.
   - Aggregate, filter, and further process data for specific use cases (e.g., customer segmentation, loyalty program insights).
   
2. **Connect to Power BI**:
   - Once your **GoldLakehouse** is ready, you can connect **Power BI** to your **GoldLakehouse** for visualization.
   - Build **dashboards** showing key insights, such as customer purchase patterns, engagement in loyalty programs, and application engagement metrics.

### **Next Steps (Phase 2)**:
Once this phase is complete, you'll have your Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers set up in Microsoft Fabric and data pipelines to bring in the e-commerce data. This will allow you to move forward with data transformation and reporting. In the next phase, you can start exploring more advanced analytics, such as predictive modeling (churn prediction, customer lifetime value estimation), or deeper integration with **Azure Machine Learning** for additional insights.
